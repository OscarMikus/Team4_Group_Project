    Decisions made:
        We decided to go with a Climbing Partner Finder App for our project.
        We decided upon our method of communicating, when we are meeting outside of class, and when we are meeting with the TA.

    Alternative actions/options discussed: 
        We discussed alternative apps like cookie clicker, a pokemon like game.
        We have thrown around some ideas like direct messaging, and a comments section that may or may not be implemented

    Follow-up items, including agreed-on roles and responsibilities:
        Matthew Finding an API for getting climbing routes
        Zach doing the minute logs
